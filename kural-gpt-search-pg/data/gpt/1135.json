  "number": 1135,
  "gptExplanation": "Kural 1135 is a beautiful representation of the romantic longing and sorrow experienced by a lover. In this verse, Valluvar uses symbolic imagery to express the pain of separation and longing for the beloved.\n\nThe kural begins with the image of a woman adorned with small garland-like bracelets. This is a reference to the beloved, who is portrayed as delicate and beautiful. The mention of the \"palmyra horse\" is a metaphorical representation of the lover's heart, suggesting that his emotions are as uncontrollable as a wild horse.\n\nThe latter part of the verse refers to the \"sorrow that is endured at night.\" This is a common theme in classical Tamil literature, where the night is often associated with painful separation and longing. The night time is depicted as a period of intense loneliness and yearning, where the lover is left alone with his thoughts and emotions.\n\nThe verse essentially conveys that the beloved has gifted the lover with two things - the uncontrollable emotions akin to a wild horse and the sorrow of nights filled with longing. Here, the gift is not physical, but emotional, emphasizing the profound impact of love and longing on the human heart. \n\nThus, the verse beautifully encapsulates the paradox of love - it is both a source of immense joy and profound sorrow. It is a testament to Valluvar's deep understanding of human emotions and the complexities of love."
