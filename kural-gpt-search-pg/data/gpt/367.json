  "gptExplanation": "Kural 367 deals with the concept of relinquishing desires to achieve a state of immortality or eternal peace. Here, Thiruvalluvar, the author of Thiru Kural, highlights the importance of overcoming worldly desires and attachments for the attainment of a higher spiritual state.\n\nThe verse suggests that if a person could completely eradicate all forms of desire, then the actions that lead to an eternal and untroubled life - often referred to as immortality - would naturally come to him. These actions are not sought out of avarice or ambition, but they spontaneously occur in the course of one's life when there are no selfish desires to cloud one's judgment and actions.\n\nIn simpler terms, the verse implies that once a person frees themselves from the shackles of desire, they naturally perform deeds that are pure, righteous, and beneficial for the self and others. This state of desirelessness does not mean inactivity or apathy. Rather, it leads to inspired and selfless action that contributes to the well-being of oneself and the world around, thus leading to a state of peace or immortality.\n\nThe cultural context here is deeply rooted in the Indian philosophical understanding of desire as the root cause of suffering. By cutting off desire, one can attain a state of peaceful existence, free from the cycle of birth and death, which is the ultimate goal of life according to various Indian philosophies."
