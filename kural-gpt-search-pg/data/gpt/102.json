  "gptExplanation": "This Kural verse highlights the immense value of timely help or favor. It emphasizes that a small favor done at the right time, during a time of need, is much more valuable than its size or cost might suggest.\n\nThe verse implies that the true worth of a favor is not just found in its material or physical aspect, but in the timeliness and relevance it holds for the person receiving it. A small act of help during a time of great need can have an impact far greater than a large favor done when it's not needed as much.\n\nFor example, providing a glass of water to someone dying of thirst in a desert is a small act but its value is immeasurable for that individual at that time. In contrast, offering gallons of water to someone living next to a river may not hold the same value.\n\nThe verse further encourages us to be mindful of the needs of others and to offer help when it is most needed, regardless of the size or nature of the help. It also underlines that the receiver will remember the timely help for a long time, making it more valuable than anything else in the world.\n\nThe moral lesson here is that the value of any act of kindness is magnified when it's done at a critical time, teaching us the importance of empathy, understanding, and timely support in human relationships."
