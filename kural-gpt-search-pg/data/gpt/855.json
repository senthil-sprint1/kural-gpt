  "gptExplanation": "Kural 855 emphasizes the virtue of overcoming hatred and animosity. The verse implies that those who have the strength to resist and move away from hatred are truly powerful. The question posed at the end, \"Who indeed would think of conquering those who naturally shrink back from hatred ?\", underscores the idea that such individuals are invincible in their moral strength. \n\nThe essence of this kural is about the power of love, peace, and understanding. It suggests that individuals who can rise above hatred, not letting it foster in their hearts, but instead respond with compassion and understanding, are truly powerful. Such people are not easily defeated by any adversities or conflicts because their strength lies in their ability to abstain from negativity and foster positivity. \n\nIn a broader context, this verse promotes the idea of peace and non-violence. It advocates for a harmonious society where conflicts are resolved not by amplifying hatred but by embracing understanding and reconciliation. The verse suggests that the real strength of a person lies not in defeating others but in overcoming one's own negative emotions. \n\nSo, this verse essentially challenges the conventional notion of victory and defeat. It proposes that the true victor is not the one who overpowers others, but the one who has the ability to resist and retreat from sentiments of hatred and animosity."
