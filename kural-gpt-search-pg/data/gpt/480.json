  "gptExplanation": "This Kural verse 480 emphasizes the importance of prudent and sustainable giving. It suggests that while generosity is a noble trait, one must also consider their own financial capabilities before giving. \n\nThe verse metaphorically communicates that if a person continues to give without considering their own capacity or wealth, their resources will deplete rapidly. This is akin to a person who keeps giving water from a tank without checking the level of water left in it. Sooner or later, the tank will be empty.\n\nIn other words, while it is commendable to help others, it is also important not to do so at the risk of your own financial stability. One should give in proportion to their means. This verse hence serves as a cautionary note against reckless and unsustainable generosity, and emphasizes the need for a balance between generosity and prudence. \n\nIn a broader sense, this verse also signifies the sustainability aspect in any resource utilization. It suggests that any resource, if used without considering its availability or replenishing it, will soon perish. Therefore, it emphasizes the need for careful and sustainable use of resources. \n\nIn summary, the verse promotes balanced and sustainable generosity and utilization of resources. It underscores the principle that charity begins at home and one should not compromise their own needs in the process of helping others."
