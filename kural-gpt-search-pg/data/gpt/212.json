  "gptExplanation": "Kural 212 emphasizes the moral responsibility of wealth distribution. It suggests that all the wealth one acquires through diligent efforts and perseverance should primarily serve a philanthropic purpose. The verse encourages the wealthy to exercise benevolence and generosity, stating that the true purpose of wealth is to aid those who are worthy and in need.\n\nThe verse implies that wealth is not just for personal consumption or enjoyment, but it should be used to uplift others, especially those who are disadvantaged or less fortunate. The wealth acquired is not meant to be hoarded, but to be utilized for the betterment of society. It advocates the practice of charity and sees it as a moral duty of the affluent.\n\nIn a broader sense, the Kural encourages the redistribution of wealth and resources in society, to reduce inequality and to promote social justice. It underpins the idea of 'giving back' to the society that contributed to one's success. The verse suggests that the act of sharing one's wealth not only benefits the receiver but also adds value and purpose to the wealth itself. \n\nThe Kural, therefore, promotes a balanced and equitable society where the needs of the less fortunate are taken care of by the more fortunate. It aligns with the traditional Indian philosophy of 'Dana' or charity, which is considered one of the highest virtues. \n\nThis verse also reflects the egalitarian values embedded in Tamil culture, where wealth is viewed not as a symbol of personal success, but as a means for communal welfare and prosperity."
