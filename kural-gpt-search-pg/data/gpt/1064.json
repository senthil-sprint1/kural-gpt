  "gptExplanation": "This verse from Thiru Kural emphasizes the nobility of self-reliance and the refusal to beg, even in the face of dire circumstances. It extols the virtue of maintaining one's dignity and self-respect, irrespective of the hardships one is going through.\n\nThe verse asserts that even the vastness of the world is insufficient to fully appreciate and honor the dignity of an individual who would not, under any circumstances, resort to begging. This dignity, the verse suggests, is a wealth that remains unconquerable and beyond measure, even if all the world's wealth were to be amassed.\n\nThe cultural context here is deeply rooted in the ancient Tamil values of self-respect and self-sufficiency. It reflects the Tamil moral principle that one should strive to be self-reliant and not depend on others for their livelihood, even in times of extreme poverty or adversity. This insistence on self-reliance is seen as a mark of true nobility and dignity.\n\nThe moral interpretation of this verse is that it is a call for resilience and determination in the face of adversity. It encourages individuals to uphold their self-dignity, reminding them that this inner strength and self-respect are invaluable, far outweighing any material wealth. It is a powerful reminder that one's self-worth is not determined by external circumstances but by one's inner character and principles."
