  "number": 283,
  "gptExplanation": "Kural 283 is a profound verse that delineates the precariousness and transient nature of wealth that is amassed through deceitful means. The verse vividly portrays that any prosperity obtained through fraudulent actions, though it might appear to multiply at first, is destined to dwindle and eventually vanish.\n\nThe verse emphasizes the moral principle that ill-gotten wealth will not last, even if it initially seems to flourish. This is due to the violation of the inherent order and justice in the universe. The act of fraud disrupts the balance, and as a consequence, the universe conspires to restore it, leading to the eventual downfall of the fraudulent.\n\nMoreover, this verse also subtly underlines the concept of Karma – the law of cause and effect. Any actions taken against the moral order, such as acquiring wealth through deceit, will have its repercussions. The person might initially enjoy the benefits of the ill-gotten wealth, but in the long run, they will have to face the consequences of their actions, leading to the loss of not just the acquired wealth, but potentially their existing assets as well.\n\nIn essence, Thiruvalluvar, through this Kural, advocates honesty and righteousness in one's actions, especially in the pursuit of wealth. He warns against the temporary and illusory nature of wealth amassed through deceit, and the inevitable ruin it brings, thus promoting ethical and honest means for wealth acquisition."
