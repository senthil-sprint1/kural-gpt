  "gptExplanation": "Kural 63 underlines the concept of children as valuable assets, not merely in a material sense, but more importantly, in terms of the moral and ethical actions they perform on behalf of their parents. \n\nThe verse emphasizes that children are considered the true wealth of parents. This is not due to any material possessions they might bring, but due to the actions they perform, the deeds they undertake, and the values they uphold. The 'wealth' here refers to the virtuous actions of the children, which reflect upon the parents and bring them honor and respect in society.\n\nThis Kural, therefore, highlights the importance of good deeds and moral conduct, which are esteemed more highly than material possessions. It underscores the notion that it is the character and actions of a person, rather than their material wealth, that truly defines their value.\n\nThus, the verse encourages parents to instill good values and moral conduct in their children, as their actions will ultimately reflect on the parents themselves. This also underlines the significant role of parents in shaping their children's character and values. \n\nIn essence, the verse stresses the fact that children, through their deeds, become the true wealth of their parents. Hence, good parenting involves nurturing children to become responsible, ethical, and virtuous individuals."
