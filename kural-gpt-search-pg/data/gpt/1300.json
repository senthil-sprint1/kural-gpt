  "gptExplanation": "This verse from Thiru Kural talks about the concept of self-alienation and its impact on our relationships. The essence of the verse is that if a person's own heart or conscience behaves like a stranger to them, then it becomes remarkably easy for outsiders or other people to behave like strangers as well.\n\nThe heart or soul here represents a person's innermost feelings, thoughts, and moral compass. When a person becomes disconnected from their own heart or inner self, they lose their self-awareness and understanding. As a result, they can no longer relate to their own emotions or values, and they may behave in ways that are out of character or against their own interests.\n\nWhen one's own heart behaves like a stranger, it indicates a state of emotional or spiritual disconnection within oneself. This internal disconnection can lead to external disconnections as well, impairing one's relationships and interactions with others.\n\nIn other words, the verse implies that the harmony in our external relationships mirrors the harmony within ourselves. If we are disconnected from our own hearts, we are likely to experience disconnection in our relationships with others. Therefore, it is crucial to maintain a strong connection with our own hearts or souls to cultivate healthy and authentic relationships with others."
