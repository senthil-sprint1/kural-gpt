  "gptExplanation": "This Thirukkural verse, Kural 199, emphasizes the wisdom and discernment of individuals who are free from ignorance and faults. These enlightened individuals are careful with their words, and they do not speak frivolously or without purpose. Even in moments of forgetfulness or distraction, they do not utter words that lack meaning or benefit.\n\nThe verse suggests the value of being mindful and intentional with one's speech. This is not only a sign of wisdom but also of respect for the listener's time and attention. Meaningless chatter is seen as a waste and a sign of a lack of self-discipline and understanding.\n\nMoreover, this verse also implies the importance of having a clear and unclouded mind. Only when one is free from the fog of ignorance can they truly understand the weight and power of words. This discernment allows them to avoid uttering statements that do not contribute to growth, understanding, or any form of positive advancement.\n\nIn essence, this verse is a reminder about the power of words and the responsibility that comes with this power. True wisdom is not just about knowing what to say, but also understanding what not to say."
