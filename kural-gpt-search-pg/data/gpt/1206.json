  "gptExplanation": "This verse from Thirukkural essentially talks about the depth of love and the longing for a beloved. The poet uses a rhetorical question to convey the intensity of his feelings. \n\nThe speaker says he survives by constantly reminiscing about the times he spent with his beloved. This indicates that his life is so intertwined with his beloved that even their past moments together have become his lifeline. The memories of their shared experiences and interactions are what keep him going and provide him comfort in their absence.\n\nHe further asks, 'If not for these memories, how else could I live?' This question underscores the fact that his existence is so deeply connected with his beloved that without them, life would be unbearable. The memories of their love are not just a part of his life, but his very reason for living. \n\nIn essence, this verse beautifully captures the profound emotional attachment and longing that one feels for their loved one, and how such feelings can become a sustaining force in their life."
