  "gptExplanation": "This verse from Thiru Kural is an insightful commentary on the importance of virtue and proper conduct in achieving greatness. \n\nThe first half of the verse discusses envy, a negative emotion that arises from desiring what others have. The verse asserts that an envious person will not have wealth. This can be understood in two ways: firstly, an envious person is always focused on what others have, rather than cultivating their own abilities and resources, leading to a lack of personal growth and prosperity. Secondly, envy tarnishes a person's character, making them unattractive to opportunities and relationships that can bring wealth.\n\nThe second half of the verse states that a person lacking in 'ozhukkam' or propriety of conduct will not achieve greatness. Propriety of conduct includes virtues such as honesty, respect for others, responsibility, and adherence to moral and ethical standards. When these virtues are absent, it is impossible for a person to rise to true greatness because they lack the moral foundation that earns respect and influence. \n\nIn essence, this verse emphasizes that character, virtue, and proper conduct are the real wealth and the key to true greatness. Without these, material wealth and status are meaningless and unattainable."
