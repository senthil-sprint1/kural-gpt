  "gptExplanation": "Kural 404 discusses the difference between acquired knowledge through education and innate wisdom. While innate wisdom or natural intelligence may be commendable, it does not hold the same value or recognition in the eyes of the learned individuals as compared to knowledge gained through formal education or self-learning. \n\nThe verse highlights the importance of structured learning and education, which not only imparts knowledge but also provides a framework to apply it effectively. It suggests that even when an uneducated person possesses good natural intelligence, it may not be considered as valuable or 'true knowledge' by those who have gained formal education. \n\nThis is because structured learning not only equips an individual with knowledge but also gives them the ability to analyze, reason, and apply that knowledge in various circumstances. Therefore, the verse emphasizes the criticality of education in shaping an individual's intellect and wisdom. \n\nThis does not undermine the value of natural intelligence, but rather underscores the importance of honing and enhancing it through formal education. The verse conveys the message that formal education and learning are essential to be recognized and respected in society, despite the natural intelligence one might possess. \n\nHowever, this Kural should not be interpreted as a depreciation of innate wisdom or intelligence, but a recognition that education gives a structure and depth to the raw intelligence, making it more acceptable and appreciable."
