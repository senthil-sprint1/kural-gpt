  "gptExplanation": "This verse from the Thirukkural, written by the ancient Tamil philosopher Valluvar, asserts the importance of thoughtful and meaningful speech. \n\nThe verse maintains that a person who consistently speaks in a manner that is widely considered offensive and without any beneficial substance will ultimately be held in contempt by everyone. The disapproval or contempt does not only come from those who are directly pained or annoyed by such speech, but from everyone in the society, as they all recognize the lack of value in his words.\n\nThe underlying moral is about the power and impact of our words. Speech is a powerful tool that can either build or destroy relationships and reputations. Valluvar advises us to use this tool wisely, to communicate effectively and respectfully, and to always consider the impact of our words on others. In essence, this Kural promotes meaningful and beneficial speech that contributes positively to society, and warns against thoughtless and offensive words."
