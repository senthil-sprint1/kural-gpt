  "gptExplanation": "Kural 268 speaks about self-realization and self-control, which are considered as the highest forms of wisdom and strength according to Thirukkural. The verse beautifully illustrates that all beings will revere the person who has achieved mastery over his own soul.\n\nThe verse starts with \"தன்னுயிர் தான் அறப் பெற்றானை\", which translates to \"he who has attained control of his own soul\". This refers to a person who has achieved self-realization, understanding, and control over his own desires, emotions, and thoughts. Such a person is not swayed by external circumstances or influenced by their own internal turmoil.\n\nThe next part \"ஏனைய மன்னுயி ரெல்லாந் தொழும்\", translates to \"all other creatures will worship him\". This signifies that such a person who has gained control over his own soul commands respect and reverence from all other beings. This could be due to the peace, wisdom, and strength that emanate from such a person, attracting others towards them.\n\nIn essence, this verse highlights the importance of self-control and self-realization. It encourages individuals to work towards mastering their own mind and emotions, as this is the path to gaining respect and reverence from others. It also subtly points out that our strength lies in our ability to control ourselves, rather than attempting to control others or external circumstances."
