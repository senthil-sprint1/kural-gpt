  "gptExplanation": "This Thiru Kural verse, Kural 564, conveys that a ruler who is known for his cruelty will lose his power and prosperity quickly. His reign will be short-lived as his harshness will only lead to his downfall.\n\nThe verse highlights the importance of justice and benevolence in leadership. When a leader is cruel, he earns the resentment and scorn of his subjects. This negative image, denoted by the term 'cruel', is a mark of a leader's failure to fulfill his responsibilities towards his people with fairness and compassion.\n\nThe phrase 'his life becoming shortened' does not necessarily imply a physical shortening of the ruler's life. Instead, it symbolizes the rapid decline of his power, status, and influence. This is because the ruler's authority is not based on fear or oppression, but on the respect and loyalty of his subjects, which can only be earned through just governance.\n\nIn a wider sense, this verse also serves as a reminder that one's actions have consequences, and those who choose cruelty and oppression over kindness and justice will face their downfall sooner or later. It's a timeless message that rings true across different eras, cultures, and societies, emphasizing the universal values of justice, compassion, and good governance."
