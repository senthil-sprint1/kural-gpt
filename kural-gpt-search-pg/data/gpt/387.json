  "gptExplanation": "This verse from Thirukkural, written by Thiruvalluvar, emphasizes the significance of affability and protection provided by a ruler to his subjects. The verse asserts that a king who is both gracious in his speech and generous in his actions, who also protects those under his governance, is revered and respected by the world. \n\nThe term 'affability' here refers to the king's cordial and polite manner of speech. It suggests that a king should not be harsh or rude, but rather, should approach his subjects with kindness and understanding. This affable demeanor helps in establishing a strong rapport with subjects and enhances the king's reputation.\n\nThe verse also underscores the importance of the king's role as a protector. The king is expected to protect his subjects from harm and provide them with the necessary support. This protective nature, when combined with generosity and affable speech, makes the king a beloved and respected figure. \n\nThe world, in turn, acknowledges such a benevolent and protective ruler, and willingly submits to his rule. The king's name is praised, and his fame spreads far and wide. Thus, the verse highlights the importance of a ruler's character and actions in earning the respect and admiration of his subjects and the world at large."
