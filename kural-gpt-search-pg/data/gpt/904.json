  "gptExplanation": "Kural 904 speaks about the importance of autonomy and confidence in one's actions, particularly in the context of a marital relationship. The verse suggests that if a man is always in fear of his wife and therefore refrains from taking any decisions or actions independently, his efforts will not be commended or respected. \n\nThis Kural does not promote the disregard of a spouse's opinions or feelings, but rather, it emphasizes the need for mutual respect and equal partnership in a relationship. A man who is continuously fearful of his wife's reactions or consequences will lack the assertiveness and confidence necessary to carry out his responsibilities effectively. This fear might result in indecisiveness and lack of initiative, which are not admirable qualities. \n\nTherefore, the verse encourages individuals to maintain their individuality and voice in a relationship while ensuring mutual respect and understanding. It is a call to avoid fear-driven decisions and actions, as they are unlikely to bring about any significant or commendable outcomes. Instead, one should strive for balance, respect, and open communication in a relationship, which will lead to more fulfilling and successful endeavours. \n\nIn a broader sense, this verse also highlights the importance of courage and self-confidence in any undertaking. Fear and doubt can cripple one's abilities and potential, leading to mediocre or unsuccessful results. Thus, one should strive to overcome their fears and act with confidence and conviction."
