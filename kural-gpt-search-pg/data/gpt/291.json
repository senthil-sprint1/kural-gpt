  "gptExplanation": "Kural 291 deals with the essence of truthfulness or honesty, which is one of the most valued virtues in all cultural and moral contexts. According to this verse, true honesty or truthfulness is not just about speaking the truth, but it's about uttering words that do not bring any harm, even in the slightest degree, to others. \n\nIn other words, the verse suggests that the virtue of honesty extends beyond just factual accuracy. It highlights the moral obligation to ensure that our words do not cause damage, pain or distress to others. It reminds us to be mindful of the impact of our words and encourages us to speak in a manner that is not only truthful, but also kind, considerate, and respectful. \n\nThis Kural emphasizes the importance of using speech as a tool for good, avoiding falsehoods, and ensuring that our honesty doesn't serve as a weapon to harm others. It underscores the importance of combining honesty with empathy and compassion in our communication. \n\nTherefore, the true embodiment of honesty, according to Thirukkural, is a speech that is not only truthful but also free from causing harm or distress to others. This is a profound reminder that our words have power and we should use them responsibly."
