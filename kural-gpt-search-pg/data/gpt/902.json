  "gptExplanation": "This Thiru Kural verse, Kural 902, discusses the negative consequences of a man being excessively devoted to his wife's feminine nature, disregarding his own masculinity or duties. \n\nIn this verse, Thiruvalluvar, the poet, emphasizes the importance of maintaining a balance in a marital relationship. He warns that a man who becomes excessively devoted or submissive to his wife's feminine charms, disregarding his own duties and responsibilities, will face humiliation and loss of respect. His wealth, gained as a result of such behaviour, will be a source of shame not only to himself but also to others.\n\nThis verse is not about demeaning women or their roles, but rather, it highlights the significance of personal responsibility and dignity in a relationship. It suggests that in a successful relationship, a man should not lose his self-respect or shirk his responsibilities, just as a woman should not. Both partners should command and give respect to each other, maintaining a harmonious balance.\n\nThiruvalluvar's wisdom in this verse is timeless, and it applies to contemporary society as well, where mutual respect, equality, and shared responsibilities form the bedrock of a healthy relationship."
