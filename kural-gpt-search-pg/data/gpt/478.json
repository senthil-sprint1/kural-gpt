  "gptExplanation": "Kural 478 emphasizes the principle of financial prudence, advising that expenditures should always be within the limits of one's income. Thiruvalluvar, the author, suggests that even if a person's or a king's income is small, it would not lead to his downfall or ruin, as long as the expenses do not exceed the income.\n\nThis verse strongly advises against extravagant or unnecessary spending that exceeds one's income, regardless of whether the income is small or large. It promotes the idea of living within one's means and not going into debt. This principle is not only applicable to individuals but also to rulers and governments, as financial mismanagement can lead to the downfall of kingdoms and countries.\n\nIn a broader sense, this kural highlights the importance of balance and moderation in life. It encourages the practice of controlled consumption and wise financial management, which are key to maintaining stability and avoiding adversity. This wisdom from the ancient Tamil text is very much relevant even today, in personal life as well as in the management of modern economies."
