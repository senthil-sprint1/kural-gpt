  "gptExplanation": "Kural 1175 portrays the agonizing power of unfulfilled love, conveyed through a poignant metaphor. The poet laments that his eyes, which were the agents of his passionate love (as intense as the boundless sea), are now suffering from sleeplessness due to the anguish of unrequited love.\n\nThe vastness of the sea is used as a metaphor to illustrate the depth and intensity of his romantic longing, which, according to the poet, was instigated by his own eyes. His eyes are personified as independent entities that played a role in instigating this profound love, and are now bearing the consequences of their actions.\n\nThe sleeplessness represents the mental turmoil and restlessness that he is experiencing as a result of his unreciprocated feelings. The poet suggests that just like the eyes were the cause of his deep love, they are now the victims of the torment that this love has brought upon him. \n\nThis verse, therefore, explores the paradoxical nature of love - it can be both the source of immense joy and profound sorrow depending upon whether it is reciprocated or not. It also highlights the interconnectedness of physical senses (in this case, sight) with emotional experiences."
