  "gptExplanation": "The verse 365 of Thiru Kural states that the only individuals truly free from the cycle of birth and death are those who have relinquished their desires. Regardless of what else they may have renounced or what other freedoms they might enjoy, if individuals still harbor desires, they are not genuinely free.\n\nIn the context of ancient Indian philosophical and spiritual traditions, this verse emphasizes the importance of overcoming desire to attain liberation (moksha or nirvana). The consumption of desires is believed to bind the soul to the material world, causing it to undergo the cycle of birth, death, and rebirth. \n\nTherefore, Thiruvalluvar, through this verse, is highlighting the importance of detachment and renunciation of desires as a pathway to ultimate liberation and freedom. This is a common theme in several spiritual philosophies, where desire is seen as the root of all suffering and the cause of our continued entanglement in the material world. \n\nIn summary, Kural 365 suggests that true freedom is not merely about renouncing material possessions or worldly ties, but about letting go of our desires and cravings. This, according to Thiruvalluvar, is the key to breaking the cycle of birth and death, and achieving true liberation."
