  "gptExplanation": "Kural 431 emphasizes the importance of humility, calmness, and self-control for those in positions of authority, specifically kings. The verse declares that the true greatness of a ruler is best reflected not by their wealth or power, but by their absence of pride, anger, and lust.\n\nPride is seen as a barrier to wisdom and understanding, as it can blind an individual to their own faults and limitations. A proud ruler might overlook the needs and perspectives of his subjects, leading to poor governance.\n\nAnger, similarly, is a destructive emotion that can cloud judgement and lead to rash decisions. A ruler who is quick to anger can foster fear and resentment among his subjects, undermining his own authority.\n\nLust, in this context, can be interpreted as an excessive desire for power, wealth, or physical pleasure. Such desires can distract a ruler from his duties and potentially lead him to act unjustly or irresponsibly.\n\nTherefore, a ruler who is free from these negative traits can lead with wisdom, fairness, and integrity. This, according to Thirukkural, is the true measure of a ruler's greatness. Such a ruler will enjoy sustainable growth and prosperity, as their leadership would be based on moral strength and balanced judgment."
