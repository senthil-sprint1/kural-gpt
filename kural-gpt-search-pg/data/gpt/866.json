  "number": 866,
  "gptExplanation": "Kural 866 advises about the people who are driven by uncontrolled anger and insatiable desire. The verse suggests that it is prudent to be wary of such individuals, and perhaps even desirable to make them your adversaries as their actions are likely to be irrational and harmful.\n\nThe verse mentions two key characteristics. The first is uncontrolled anger, which is often blind, leading to rash decisions without considering the consequences. This can be destructive both for the individual and those around them. The second is an insatiable lust or desire, which also leads to reckless and irresponsible actions, as the person is consumed by their desires and disregards ethics and morals.\n\nThus, the verse highlights the dangers of associating with such individuals. It suggests that it might be better to have such people as enemies rather than allies, as their behavior can be detrimental to one's well-being and peace. \n\nThe verse also underscores the importance of self-control, balance, and moderation in emotions and desires, indirectly implying that these are the traits of a virtuous individual."
