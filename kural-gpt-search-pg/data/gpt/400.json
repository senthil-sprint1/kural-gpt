  "gptExplanation": "This verse asserts the importance and value of education or learning over any other forms of wealth. The poet Thiruvalluvar emphasizes that only learning or knowledge is the true, imperishable wealth that a person can acquire. This is because all other forms of wealth, such as money, property, or material possessions, are transient and can be lost, stolen, or diminished over time. They are subject to decay, destruction, or loss. \n\nHowever, knowledge or learning, once gained, cannot be taken away. It not only enriches the person who possesses it but also enables him/her to enrich others. It is a source of continual growth and development, and it is a wealth that increases by sharing. This wealth of knowledge also has the power to generate other forms of wealth and provide a person with a dignified and respected position in society. \n\nTherefore, Thiruvalluvar strongly suggests that one should strive for the acquisition of knowledge, as it is the only true and everlasting wealth. This is a universal truth applicable to all cultures and societies, and it underscores the timeless wisdom of Thiruvalluvar's Thirukkural."
