  "gptExplanation": "This verse from Thirukkural (Kural 331) emphasizes the pitfalls of ignorance. The verse warns about the dangers of considering transient or temporal things as permanent. It advises people to have the wisdom to differentiate between what is permanent and what is not. \n\nIn life, many things are temporary and fleeting. Wealth, power, fame, and even life itself are transient. However, people often forget this truth, considering these fleeting aspects as stable and permanent. This ignorance can lead to attachments and desires which might, in turn, lead to sorrow and disappointment when these things inevitably change or disappear.\n\nThe wisdom to understand the impermanence of worldly things fosters detachment and equanimity, leading to inner peace and fulfillment. This understanding is seen as honorable and esteemed in a wise person's perspective.\n\nTherefore, the verse encourages the cultivation of wisdom to discern the true nature of things and avoid the dishonor that comes from ignorance. It prompts us to value and seek what is truly enduring and meaningful, such as knowledge, virtue, and inner peace."
