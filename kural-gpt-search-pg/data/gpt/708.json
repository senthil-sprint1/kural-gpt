  "gptExplanation": "Kural 708 emphasizes the importance of understanding and empathy, particularly in the context of a ruler's relationship with his advisors or councillors. \n\nIn this verse, Saint Thiruvalluvar suggests that a good king should surround himself with individuals who are capable of understanding his thoughts, intentions, and emotions without him having to express them verbally. This capacity to 'read' the king's mind is a result of deep understanding, empathy, and familiarity. \n\nThe verse essentially asserts that if a king has such advisors who can discern his thoughts by merely looking at him, then it would suffice for the king to simply stand and look at their faces. In other words, the king does not have to articulate his thoughts, worries or plans; these wise advisors will understand his intentions and be able to provide counsel or take actions accordingly. \n\nThis kural underscores the importance of mutual understanding and unspoken communication in effective leadership. It also highlights the value of empathy and insightful perception in governance and decision making."
