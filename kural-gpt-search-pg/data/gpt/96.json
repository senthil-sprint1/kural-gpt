  "gptExplanation": "Kural 96 emphasizes the importance and power of positive and kind communication. It suggests that if a person consciously chooses to speak words that are beneficial and pleasant to others, two significant outcomes will occur: first, their sins or negative actions will decrease, and second, their virtue or righteousness will flourish.\n\nThis verse essentially stresses the transformative power of speech. It implies that speech, when used wisely and kindly, can serve as a tool for moral and spiritual growth. By discarding harmful, negative, or unnecessary words and focusing on uttering words that bring goodness and joy to others, one can indeed cultivate virtue within oneself and in their surroundings.\n\nThe wisdom of this verse is timeless. In today's world, where harsh words and criticism are often the norm, the verse encourages us to choose words that are not only useful but also sweet. It reminds us that our words can have a profound effect on others and ourselves. Thus, it promotes mindfulness in our communication, urging us to use our words as seeds of virtue and goodness.\n\nIn summary, Thirukkural 96 advocates for a conscious and mindful approach to communication, where one's words are chosen not only for their usefulness but also for their ability to bring joy and positivity. It suggests that such an approach can lead to personal growth, diminishing one's negative actions and enhancing their virtue."
