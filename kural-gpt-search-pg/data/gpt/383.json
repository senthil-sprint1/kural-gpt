  "gptExplanation": "Kural 383 emphasizes the essential attributes that a ruler or leader should possess. These attributes are vigilance, learning, and bravery. \n\nVigilance suggests a state of being alert and watchful, particularly in the face of potential danger or difficulty. It is the unceasing attention to what is happening around one's environment. A vigilant ruler is able to foresee issues and address them proactively, ensuring the safety and well-being of his people.\n\nLearning refers to acquiring knowledge through study, experience, or being taught. A learned ruler is one who possesses deep and broad knowledge, enabling him to make informed decisions. His wisdom gained through learning allows him to guide his people effectively, and his understanding of various fields makes him a versatile leader.\n\nBravery is the quality of having courage. This courage is not only physical but also moral - the ability to do what is right even in the face of adversity. A brave ruler is one who is undeterred by challenges and threats, willing to take bold steps for the greater good of his people.\n\nThe Kural asserts that these three qualities - vigilance, learning, and bravery - should be ever-present in a ruler. They are not only desirable attributes but also necessary ones for effective governance and leadership. A ruler lacking in any of these qualities may lead his country into chaos and disorder. Hence, these qualities should remain unwavering, sustaining the ruler and, by extension, the land he governs."
