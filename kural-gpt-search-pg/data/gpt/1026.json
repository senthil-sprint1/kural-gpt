  "gptExplanation": "Kural 1026 explores the concept of true manliness or virtuous manhood. In this verse, Thiruvalluvar suggests that a man's worth and virtue are not determined by his physical strength, wealth, social status, or any other superficial measure. Rather, true manliness is the ability of a man to take responsibility for his family, to provide for them, and to be the pillar of support they lean on. \n\nThis notion of manliness extends beyond just providing material needs; it also includes moral leadership, nurturing, and guidance. By assuming such a role, a man brings honor not only to himself but also to the family he was born into. \n\nIn essence, Thiruvalluvar is emphasizing the moral and ethical responsibilities that come with manhood. Being a man is not just about being born male, but about embracing the duties and responsibilities that come with it, especially in the context of family and society.\n\nThis verse is a reflection of the societal norms and values of the period when Thiruvalluvar wrote the Thirukkural. It places high importance on familial responsibilities, moral leadership, and societal contribution as measures of a man's worth."
