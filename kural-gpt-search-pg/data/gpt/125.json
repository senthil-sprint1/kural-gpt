  "gptExplanation": "The Kural 125 emphasizes the virtue of humility for all people, irrespective of their social or economic status. However, it specifically states that humility acquires an even more significant value when it is found in wealthy individuals.\n\nHumility is a virtue that brings goodness to everyone. It helps maintain harmony and respect in all relationships and interactions. The humble person is often respected and loved by others because of their modest behavior and lack of arrogance, regardless of their social status or wealth.\n\nHowever, when a rich person exhibits humility, it is seen as an additional wealth, beyond their material possessions. This is because wealth often brings with it a sense of superiority and pride, which can lead to arrogance and a lack of respect for others. When a rich person is humble, it signifies that they have not allowed their wealth to corrupt their character or values. They understand that their wealth does not make them superior to others and that they should treat everyone with equal respect and kindness.\n\nTherefore, this verse recognizes humility as a universal virtue but particularly appreciates it in the wealthy. It serves as a reminder that true wealth is not just about material possessions but also about possessing commendable character traits like humility."
