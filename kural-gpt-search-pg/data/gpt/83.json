  "gptExplanation": "Kural 83 is an ode to the virtue of hospitality. It suggests that the life of a person who consistently welcomes and takes care of guests will never be ruined by poverty or hardships.\n\nIn the Tamil culture, guests are considered as godly figures, and it is a moral responsibility to treat them with utmost respect and care. This Kural emphasizes the importance of this virtue and assures that the act of generosity and hospitality will be rewarded by preventing one's life from being overcome by hardship and poverty. \n\nEssentially, the Kural conveys that the act of giving and sharing, especially with those who visit us, creates a protective shield against adversity in life. This could be because the act of giving enhances the giver's own sense of fulfilment and joy, which in turn enriches their life. \n\nMoreover, this continuous act of hospitality promotes a sense of community, goodwill, and mutual support, which are vital for a fulfilling life. Thus, the Kural encourages the practice of hospitality as a means of creating a prosperous and resilient life. \n\nThis verse is a reminder that the generosity we extend towards others is ultimately a gift to ourselves, as it shields us from the downfall of poverty and hardship, ensuring a life of abundance and prosperity."
