  "gptExplanation": "This verse from Thirukkural emphasises on the diverse natures of the world, particularly in terms of wealth and knowledge acquisition. It suggests that the natural order of the world is such that some individuals are destined to be wealthy, while others are destined to be knowledgeable. \n\nThe verse acknowledges the existence of fate and how it influences the distribution of wealth and knowledge among individuals. Some people are naturally inclined towards material wealth and spend their lives accumulating it. On the other hand, some people are drawn towards intellectual wealth and spend their lives in pursuit of knowledge and wisdom. \n\nHowever, it does not mean one is superior to the other. Both wealth and knowledge have their respective places and roles in life. Wealth is necessary for physical sustenance and comfort, while knowledge enhances understanding and wisdom. The difference is based on the natural order of the world, and not on personal merit or virtue.\n\nThirukkural here teaches us to respect this diversity and understand that each person has a unique path. It encourages acceptance, as these differences are a result of the world's natural order and not a matter of individual choice. It promotes the idea of coexistence and harmony among individuals with differing fortunes and capabilities."
