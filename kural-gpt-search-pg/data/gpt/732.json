  "gptExplanation": "Kural 732 speaks about the ideal qualities of a successful and prosperous nation. According to this Kural, a kingdom or a nation is considered prosperous and successful when it possesses extensive wealth. Such wealth not only constitutes material riches but also includes resources like knowledge, culture, and natural resources.\n\nThe verse also mentions that a prosperous nation is one that is desired by others. This could mean that other nations admire or envy it because of its wealth and prosperity, indicating its high standing amongst its peers.\n\nFurthermore, the Kural emphasizes that an ideal nation should be free from any destructive causes. This could refer to a variety of factors such as social unrest, corruption, natural calamities, or invasion by external forces. A nation that is free from these destructive forces is more likely to flourish and prosper.\n\nFinally, the verse asserts that a prosperous nation is one which grows greatly in prosperity. This indicates that a successful nation doesn't stagnate but constantly strives for growth and improvement, continually enhancing its wealth and well-being.\n\nIn conclusion, Kural 732 provides a well-rounded definition of a prosperous nation - one that is rich in resources, admired by others, free from destructive causes, and constantly growing in prosperity."
