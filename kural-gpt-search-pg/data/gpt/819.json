  "gptExplanation": "Kural 819 emphasizes the importance of congruence between words and actions in any relationship, especially friendship. The verse warns that befriending those who don't align their actions with their words can lead to distress and discomfort, even in one's dreams. This is because such individuals are often unreliable and untrustworthy, causing unpredictability and unease in the relationship. \n\nThe verse underscores the value of sincerity and honesty in friendships. It implies that true friends are those who not only say what they mean but also follow through with their promises through their actions. Such friendships are harmonious and peaceful, devoid of any distressing surprises. Conversely, friendships with those whose words and deeds are inconsistent can lead to confusion, disappointment, and distress, even invading one's dreams with worry.\n\nIn a broader sense, this verse serves as a reminder to assess the sincerity and reliability of individuals before forming close relationships with them. It also encourages individuals to strive for consistency in their own words and deeds, to foster trust and harmony within their relationships."
