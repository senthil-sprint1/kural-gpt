  "gptExplanation": "Kural 139 emphasizes the virtue of propriety in one's speech. The verse suggests that those who truly understand and embody the principles of good conduct or 'ozhukkam' (in Tamil) will not speak ill or negatively, even by mistake or in a moment of forgetfulness. Such individuals are so deeply ingrained with the principles of righteousness that their words naturally align with their virtuous conduct. \n\nThe verse underscores the importance of not just controlling one's actions, but also one's words, as they carry immense power and can have significant impact on others. This verse encourages us to be mindful of our speech, to ensure that our words reflect respect, kindness, and goodwill, even when we are caught off guard or in a state of forgetfulness.\n\nIn a broader sense, this verse teaches us that good conduct is not a switch we turn on and off when convenient, but a constant state of being that permeates all aspects of our life, including our speech. It's a reminder that our words are a mirror to our character and values, and thus, we should strive to speak only what is true, kind, and beneficial."
