  "gptExplanation": "This verse, Kural 575, from the Thirukkural, emphasizes the importance of empathy and compassion as reflected in one's gaze. The \"ornaments of the eyes\" here metaphorically refer to the expressions of kindness, warmth, and understanding that one's eyes can convey. \n\nIn essence, the verse suggests that the true value of the eyes lies not in their physical aspect, but in their ability to express and communicate kindness and empathy towards others. If the eyes lack this virtue of expressing compassion, they are considered no more than two sores, devoid of their true purpose. This metaphor of eyes being labeled as sores if devoid of kindness underscores the significance the poet attaches to empathy and compassion.\n\nThe eyes, according to the poet, are not just organs of sight, but powerful tools of communication that can reflect the inner state of a person. If that inner state is devoid of kindness, then the eyes, regardless of their physical health or beauty, are seen as unappealing or even diseased. \n\nIn a broader sense, this verse illustrates the high importance that Thirukkural places on empathy and kindness, suggesting that these virtues are not just desirable, but essential to being considered truly human."
