  "gptExplanation": "This Kural verse advocates for a mentality free of envy, advising one to regard such a disposition as highly as moral and ethical conduct. The verse emphasizes that refraining from envy should be an innate characteristic of an individual, just like adhering to proper conduct and ethics. \n\nIn essence, Thiruvalluvar, the author, is encouraging individuals to cultivate a mindset that does not harbor envy or resentment towards others' success or prosperity. He suggests that this kind of mental discipline is as important as maintaining good conduct. By doing so, individuals can lead a peaceful and harmonious life, fostering goodwill and understanding among each other. \n\nThe cultural context here underlines the importance of inner virtues in Tamil society, where qualities like envy-free mind are placed on par with external behavior reflecting one's character. This verse is a call for internal self-improvement, asserting that a person's true character is reflected not just in their actions, but also in their thoughts and feelings. Thus, a truly virtuous person should be free from envy in both thought and deed."
