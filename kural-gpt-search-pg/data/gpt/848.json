  "gptExplanation": "Thiru Kural 848 conveys the message about the harmful consequences of ignorance and the refusal to learn from others. It emphasizes the detrimental effect of not willing to perform the duties suggested by others, as well as not being able to understand them on one's own. \n\nThe first line \"ஏவவும் செய்கலான் தான்தேறான்\" literally translates to \"the one who doesn't perform even when advised, nor learns on his own\". This refers to a person who is not only unresponsive to advice or guidance from others but also lacks the initiative or ability to understand their responsibilities by themselves. Such a person is oblivious to their duties and does not make an effort to learn or improve.\n\nThe second line \"அவ்வுயிர் போஒம் அளவுமோர் நோய்\" translates to \"such a soul is a perpetual disease till its end\". Here, Thiruvalluvar likens the person's life to a relentless disease, implying that their ignorance and refusal to learn is a chronic ailment, persisting till the end of their life.\n\nIn essence, this Kural warns about the destructive consequences of ignorance and the refusal to learn or perform duties. It advocates for the importance of learning, self-improvement, and fulfilling responsibilities in living a meaningful and productive life. The persistent ignorance is seen as a chronic disease, hindering the growth and progress of the individual, thus leading to a wasted life. The verse serves as a reminder to always be open to advice, to be proactive in learning and to fulfill one's responsibilities diligently."
