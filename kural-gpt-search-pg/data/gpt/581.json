  "gptExplanation": "Kural 581 emphasizes the importance of intelligence and law for a ruler. The verse metaphorically suggests that a ruler should consider a spy (intelligence network) and a universally esteemed book of laws as his 'eyes'. \n\nIn this context, the 'spy' represents a reliable source of information. A king should have trustworthy messengers or spies who can provide him with honest, accurate, and timely information about the state of his kingdom, the mood of his subjects, and any threats or challenges that might be arising. The importance of having a capable intelligence network can't be overstated, as it enables a ruler to make informed decisions and anticipate problems before they become crises.\n\nThe 'book of laws', on the other hand, symbolizes sound governance and justice. A universally esteemed book of laws indicates a set of rules and regulations that have been proven over time to be fair, just, and effective. A king should govern his kingdom based on these established laws, ensuring that justice is served and that his subjects are treated fairly.\n\nIn essence, this verse suggests that a successful ruler is one who combines effective intelligence gathering with fair and just governance. The king's 'eyes', in this metaphor, are the tools he uses to see and understand his kingdom, and these tools should be reliable (spies) and righteous (the book of laws)."
