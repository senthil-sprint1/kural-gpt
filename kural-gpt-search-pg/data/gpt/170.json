  "gptExplanation": "This verse from the Thiru Kural emphasizes the significance of envy in the journey of success. Thiruvalluvar, the author, prescribes that envy is a detrimental trait that inhibits one's path to greatness. He asserts that there have been no instances where envious individuals have reached heights of success. Envy, in this context, is seen as a barrier to personal growth and prosperity.\n\nConversely, he underscores that those who are free from the clutches of envy have never been without greatness. It implies that the absence of envy fosters personal development and paves the way for success. This absence permits individuals to focus on their own progress rather than comparing themselves to others which often leads to unnecessary dissatisfaction and resentment.\n\nIn essence, the verse portrays envy as a negative emotion that obstructs the path to success and self-improvement. In contrast, a lack of envy enables individuals to focus on their own growth and accomplishments, leading to a state of greatness. Therefore, Thiruvalluvar encourages the elimination of envy to achieve personal success and satisfaction."
