  "number": 403,
  "gptExplanation": "Kural 403 emphasizes the virtue of humility and the power of silence, especially in the presence of the learned or the knowledgeable. The verse suggests that even those who are uneducated can be considered as excellent individuals if they have the wisdom to stay silent when they are in the company of those who are learned.\n\nThe underlying message of this verse is the importance of acknowledging one's limitations. By choosing to remain silent in the presence of the learned, an uneducated individual shows respect for knowledge and learning, and acknowledges their own lack of it. This act of humility and respect can make them just as admirable as those who are learned.\n\nMoreover, silence in this context is not a sign of ignorance, but of wisdom. It suggests an understanding that speaking without knowledge can lead to mistakes or misinformation. So, it's better to listen and learn from the knowledgeable than to speak without understanding.\n\nIn broader terms, this verse promotes the idea that one's worth is not solely determined by their educational status, but also by their behavior, attitude, and understanding of the world around them."
