  "number": 740,
  "gptExplanation": "Kural 740 speaks about the importance of harmony between the ruler and the ruled in a country. Even if a country is endowed with all kinds of natural resources and wealth, they are meaningless if there is a lack of good governance and rapport between the sovereign and the subjects.\n\nThe Kural emphasizes that the wealth of a nation is not just its material resources, but also the harmony, unity, and mutual respect between its ruler and its people. It suggests that without good governance and a ruler who genuinely cares for his or her subjects, all the wealth and resources are of no use. They cannot bring prosperity or happiness to the people.\n\nIn essence, this Kural highlights the critical role of leadership in a nation's development and prosperity. It underscores that an effective and empathetic leader is one who maintains a harmonious relationship with his subjects, understanding their needs, and working towards their welfare. Without such a leader, even a resource-rich nation can fail to prosper. \n\nSo, the Kural implies that good governance and a harmonious relationship between the ruler and the people are more valuable than any material resources or wealth."
