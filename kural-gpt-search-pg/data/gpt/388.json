  "gptExplanation": "Kural 388 asserts the importance of a ruler in fulfilling his duties and safeguarding his subjects. This verse highlights the role of a king as a protector and an upholder of justice. \n\nThe king, according to this verse, is not just a figurehead, but an active participant in the welfare and safety of his subjects. He is expected to perform his duties with integrity and fairness, ensuring that his subjects are protected from harm and injustice. \n\nThis kural also underscores the reverence people have for a ruler who fulfills his responsibilities. Such a ruler is esteemed as a 'God among men.' This is not just for the power he wields, but for his just and fair rule, which creates a peaceful and prosperous kingdom. \n\nThus, the verse brings to light the ideals of good governance, emphasising the role of a ruler as a protector of his subjects and an upholder of justice and fairness. The king who does so is not just respected, but revered and worshipped like a deity. His rule becomes an example of virtuous governance, inspiring loyalty and devotion among his subjects."
