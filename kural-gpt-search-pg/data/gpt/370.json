  "gptExplanation": "Kural 370 emphasizes the power of eliminating desires, which are by nature insatiable. It suggests that the act of overcoming one's unquenchable desires can lead to a state of being that is unchanging and filled with lasting happiness.\n\nIn the first line of the verse, Thiruvalluvar speaks about the nature of desires. Desires are depicted as never being satisfied, no matter how much we try to fulfill them. This is a reflection of human nature where we tend to want more, no matter how much we already have.\n\nThe second line of the verse provides the solution to this problem. It suggests that eliminating such desires can lead to a state of unchanging nature. This state of being is one of contentment, happiness, and peace, which is unaffected by external circumstances. It is a state where one is not swayed by materialistic wants or worldly pleasures.\n\nIn essence, the Kural teaches us that the key to lasting happiness and contentment lies in overcoming our insatiable desires. When we learn to be satisfied with what we have and let go of our endless wants, we attain a state of being that is stable, peaceful, and filled with joy. This state, once achieved, is unchanging and lasting. This is a timeless piece of wisdom that is as relevant today as it was when it was written."
