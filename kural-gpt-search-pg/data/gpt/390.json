  "number": 390,
  "gptExplanation": "Kural 390 speaks about the four essential qualities of a true king or leader. These are beneficence, benevolence, rectitude, and care for his people.\n\nBeneficence refers to the act of providing what is needed for the welfare of the people. A good leader is generous and willing to give to ensure the well-being of his subjects. This is not just about material gifts, but also about providing opportunities, guidance, and support to help the people grow and prosper.\n\nBenevolence is about kindness and compassion. A true leader has empathy for his people, understands their problems and needs, and takes actions that are in their best interest. He treats everyone with kindness and does not let his personal feelings or biases influence his decisions.\n\nRectitude is about fairness and justice. A good ruler maintains a just and balanced administration. He treats everyone equally, regardless of their social status or personal background. He ensures that justice is served and that everyone's rights are protected.\n\nLastly, a good leader genuinely cares for his people. He values their well-being above everything else, and works tirelessly to protect them from harm. He listens to their concerns, understands their needs, and takes appropriate actions to address them.\n\nA leader who embodies these four qualities is considered the \"light of kings\", as he guides his people towards prosperity and happiness. His leadership shines brightly, setting an example for others to follow. He earns the respect and love of his people, and leaves a lasting legacy of good governance."
