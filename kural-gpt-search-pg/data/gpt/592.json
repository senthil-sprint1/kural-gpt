  "gptExplanation": "This verse from Thiru Kural emphasizes the importance of mental strength and determination, stating that it is the true wealth a person can possess. The verse says that the ownership of material wealth is transient and does not stay with one forever. \n\nThe term \"possession of the mind\" refers to the inner strength, motivation, and willpower an individual has. According to Valluvar, this is the true and permanent asset that an individual can possess. It is this mental energy that drives a person to strive, overcome obstacles, and achieve their goals.\n\nOn the other hand, material wealth, though valued highly in the worldly sense, is described as fleeting. It can be acquired and lost, and does not remain constant. Material wealth also does not guarantee happiness or contentment. Thus, Valluvar emphasizes that it is not a true possession.\n\nIn essence, this verse advocates the development of inner strength and resilience, as they are the real assets that help an individual navigate through life's challenges. It also subtly reminds us of the impermanence of material wealth, urging us to not be overly attached to it."
