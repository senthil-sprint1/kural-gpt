  "gptExplanation": "Kural 1047 deals with the harsh reality of extreme poverty and societal perception. The verse states that when a person slips into the abyss of destitution, devoid of righteousness, even their own mother would regard them as a stranger. \n\nThe emphasis here is not necessarily on the literal maternal relationship, but more on the perception of society and close relations. In the Tamil culture, a mother symbolizes unconditional love, compassion, and forgiveness. If even a mother, who is usually the last person to abandon her child, starts perceiving her child as a stranger, it indicates the immense degradation that poverty can cause in a person's social standing.\n\nMoreover, it underlines the unfortunate reality that society often measures a person's worth by their wealth and material possessions. The 'unrighteous poverty' mentioned in the verse refers to poverty that is not born out of misfortune, but due to the individual's lack of moral character and discipline.\n\nThus, the kural advises maintaining moral integrity and character, regardless of one's economic standing, as these virtues are valued more than wealth in a righteous society. It also subtly critiques societal norms that measure a person's worth based on their wealth or lack thereof."
