  "gptExplanation": "This Kural pertains to the virtue of generosity, especially towards those less fortunate. The verse metaphorically compares amassed wealth that is not used for the benefit of the needy to a beautiful woman who ages without ever being married.\n\nThe premise here is that wealth, just like beauty, is not merely for the purpose of personal possession or enjoyment. Rather, it should be used for the benefit and welfare of others, especially those who are less fortunate. In the same way, the beauty of a woman is not just for her own admiration, but it is meant to be shared and appreciated in the sanctity of marriage, and to contribute to the cycle of life.\n\nThe verse suggests that wealth that is not shared with those in need is essentially useless and frittered away, just like beauty that is not shared in a marital union is wasted as it fades with time. This resonates with the philosophy of sharing and caring, which is a cornerstone of many cultures and religions worldwide.\n\nThis Kural highlights the moral responsibility of those who are wealthy to help those in need. It implies that the true value of wealth lies not in accumulation, but in distribution for the betterment of society. Similarly, the true value of beauty lies not in vanity, but in its appreciation within the context of a loving, committed relationship. The verse encourages us to be generous and to use our resources, whether it is wealth or beauty, for the greater good."
