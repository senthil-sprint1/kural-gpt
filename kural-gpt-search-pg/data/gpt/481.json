  "gptExplanation": "This verse from Thiru Kural emphasizes the importance of timing in achieving victory. It uses the analogy of a crow and an owl to illustrate this point. In the day time, a crow, though smaller and weaker, can overcome an owl because the owl, being nocturnal, is at a disadvantage during the day. The owl's strength and prowess are diminished in the daytime, and the crow can take advantage of this.\n\nTranslating this analogy to a king's battle scenario, the verse suggests that even a powerful enemy can be defeated if the timing is right. Just as the crow waits for the day to confront the owl, a king should also choose the most opportune time to engage with his enemies. The king must consider various factors such as his enemy's weaknesses, his own strengths, and the most advantageous circumstances to ensure victory. \n\nSo, this Kural teaches us that strategic timing is as critical as strength and power in achieving success, not just in warfare but in any challenging situation in life. It encourages us to understand and take advantage of the right timing or 'opportune moment' to turn situations in our favor. The wisdom of this verse is timeless and applicable in various contexts, from personal endeavors to business strategies."
