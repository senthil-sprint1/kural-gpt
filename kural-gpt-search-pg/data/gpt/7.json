  "gptExplanation": "This verse speaks to the profound peace and tranquility that comes from deep spiritual devotion. The 'Him who is incomparable' referred to in this verse is a representation of the divine or god, a power that is beyond comparison or equal. The 'feet' symbolize surrender or submission, a well-known concept in spiritual practices, where one submits their ego and worldly concerns to the divine.\n\nThiruvalluvar, the author, states that the anxieties of the mind, which could include worries, fears, doubts, and other negative emotions, can only be truly resolved or removed by those who surrender themselves to the divine. This surrender is not about passivity or resignation, but about active trust and faith. It's about letting go of the need to control and instead placing trust in the divine order of things.\n\nThis verse thus emphasizes the importance of spirituality and the belief in a higher power in overcoming mental distress. It suggests that human efforts alone might be insufficient to completely eradicate mental agony. Instead, it is through the combination of one's efforts with spiritual faith and surrender to the divine power, that one can achieve true peace of mind.\n\nIt should be noted that interpretations could vary based on one's personal beliefs and philosophies. Some might interpret the 'Him who is incomparable' as their personal deity, a spiritual guru, or even a set of philosophical principles that guide their life. The central idea, however, remains the same - that ultimate peace comes from surrender to something greater than ourselves."
