  "gptExplanation": "This verse from Thiru Kural emphasizes on the power of inner peace and control over anger. The verse translates to \"If a man never indulges anger in his heart, he will at once obtain whatever he has thought of\". \n\nHere, Thiruvalluvar, the poet, is not just underscoring the negative impact of anger but also highlighting the positive outcomes of maintaining inner peace and tranquility. Anger is often a self-destructive emotion that clouds judgement, disrupts clarity of thoughts and leads to actions that one might regret later. On the contrary, maintaining a calm and composed mind enables clear thinking, better decision-making and thus, increases the likelihood of achieving what one desires or has thought of. \n\nThe verse suggests that the absence of anger in one’s heart is not merely a state of emotional balance, but a source of power that can help fulfill one’s desires and ambitions. It conveys that a person who can control his anger is likely to achieve his goals faster than the one who lets anger rule his heart. \n\nIn a broader sense, it advocates for emotional intelligence and self-control, emphasizing that our emotions should be managed and directed towards constructive ends rather than letting them control us. This timeless wisdom is applicable even today in various aspects of life, be it personal relationships, professional endeavors, or spiritual growth."
