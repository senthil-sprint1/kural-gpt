  "gptExplanation": "Kural 1004 explores the consequences of miserliness and the lack of benevolence. In this verse, Valluvar uses a rhetorical question to underscore the repercussions of being ungenerous, especially in the context of how one will be remembered after death.\n\nThe verse says, \"What will the miser who is not liked by anyone regard as his own in the world to come?\" Here, the poet is implying that a miser, who is disliked by all due to his unwillingness to help others, will have nothing to claim as his own in the afterlife. This is because, according to the poet's worldview, our deeds and generosity in the present world determine our legacy and influence our state in the life to come.\n\nThe underlying moral lesson of this Kural is the importance of generosity and benevolence. It advises against hoarding wealth and prompts individuals to share their resources with others. This verse also hints at the concept of karma, where our actions in this world have repercussions in the next.\n\nIn essence, Thiruvalluvar suggests that the measure of a person's life is not their material wealth, but how much they have given to others. Those who live selfishly, refusing to share their wealth, will have nothing to look forward to in the afterlife, and will be remembered poorly or not at all in this world."
