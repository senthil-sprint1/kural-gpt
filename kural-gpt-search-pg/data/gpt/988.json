  "gptExplanation": "Kural 988 emphasizes the importance of personal virtues over material wealth. The verse argues that poverty is not a disgrace or a disgraceful state if one possesses good qualities. The \"good qualities\" referred to here— often translated as \"virtue\", \"moral strength\", or \"noble character\"— symbolizes the moral and ethical strength of a person. \n\nThe verse suggests that the lack of material wealth is not a mark of shame if one is rich in virtues. It implies that the true measure of a person's worth is not their material wealth, but their moral and ethical character. In other words, being virtuous gives one a kind of wealth that cannot be measured in material terms. In this light, poverty is seen not as a deficiency, but as a circumstance that does not diminish a person's true value if they possess good qualities.\n\nThe moral interpretation of this verse encourages individuals to cultivate good qualities such as honesty, kindness, and integrity, irrespective of their material circumstances. Rather than viewing poverty as a disadvantage or a shortcoming, it motivates individuals to seek richness in character and moral fiber. This verse thus emphasizes the timeless wisdom that a person's worth is determined more by their character than by their material possessions."
