  "gptExplanation": "This verse from Thiru Kural emphasizes the negative attribute of envy. The verse says that a person who harbors envy towards the prosperity and wealth of others is someone who neither values virtue nor seeks wealth.\n\nThis verse underlines the importance of appreciating and rejoicing in the success of others, rather than being envious. It points out that envy is a destructive emotion that not only harms relationships but also hinders one's personal growth and development. \n\nThe verse further suggests that such a person shows no interest in gaining virtue or wealth. This is because envy often stems from a lack of contentment and satisfaction. A person who is content with what he/she has will not covet others' wealth. On the other hand, a person who is discontented will always compare his/her situation with others and develop feelings of envy. \n\nHence, it is important to cultivate a sense of contentment and satisfaction in life. This can lead to inner peace, happiness, and personal growth. Furthermore, it can also foster positive relationships with others, as one learns to appreciate their success without harboring feelings of envy. \n\nFrom a moral perspective, this verse teaches us the importance of avoiding envy and cultivating a sense of appreciation and contentment. It encourages us to strive for personal growth and development, rather than wasting our energy on negative emotions like envy. It tells us to value virtue and wealth, and to seek them through rightful means, instead of coveting what others have."
