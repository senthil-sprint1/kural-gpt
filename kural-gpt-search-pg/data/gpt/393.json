  "gptExplanation": "The Kural 393 is a metaphorical verse that highlights the value of knowledge and learning. According to the verse, those who are learned are said to truly \"have eyes\", highlighting the idea that knowledge and wisdom give one the ability to see and understand the world in a way that those without knowledge cannot. \n\nThe verse underscores that the value of eyes is not in their physical existence, but in the understanding and perception they offer. Eyes are symbolic of awareness and understanding here. Hence, the learned, despite being physically blind, are considered to have eyes because they possess knowledge.\n\nOn the other hand, it refers to the unlearned as those with \"merely two sores in their face\", meaning that without knowledge and wisdom, even the physical eyes are of no use. They are likened to sores, serving no purpose, because they lack the insight and understanding that comes with learning. \n\nIn essence, this verse is a powerful commentary on the importance of knowledge and the pursuit of learning. It asserts that true sight comes not from the physical eyes, but from the understanding and wisdom gained through learning."
