  "gptExplanation": "Kural 544 emphasizes the importance of benevolent leadership. It tells us that a king who rules with compassion and love for his subjects will be respected and revered throughout the world. His rule is not enforced through fear or coercion, but through the affection and loyalty he earns from his subjects by treating them with kindness and fairness.\n\nIn the sociopolitical context, this Kural conveys that when a ruler governs with empathy, understanding, and fairness, he will be universally admired. Such a leader's influence extends beyond his kingdom's boundaries, and he will be remembered and respected globally. This verse emphasizes the need for rulers to govern their subjects with love and justice, and not with an iron fist. \n\nIn a broader sense, this Kural is applicable to anyone in a position of authority, not just kings. It could be a leader in any field - politics, business, academics, etc. The essence of the verse is that a good leader will always be loved and respected if they lead with empathy, love, and fairness. \n\nHence, the world will invariably respect and honour the ruler who governs his people with love, just like how people embrace the feet of a great king out of reverence and respect. The feet here symbolize humility, stability, and grounding, indicating that such a leader remains humble and grounded despite their authority and power."
