  "gptExplanation": "Kural 460 emphasizes the significance of the company one keeps. It states that there is no greater assistance or support one can have than being in the company of virtuous individuals, those who uphold good values and principles. These individuals inspire others to lead a righteous life and their influence often guides one towards the path of goodness and wisdom. \n\nConversely, the verse warns against the company of wicked or immoral individuals. It suggests that there is no greater source of distress or sorrow than being associated with such individuals. The negative influence of the wicked can lead one astray, causing turmoil and hardships in their life.\n\nThe crux of this verse lies in the understanding that our company significantly influences our character, actions, and ultimately our life. Hence, keeping good company is the most beneficial support one can have, and avoiding bad company is the greatest relief from potential sorrow. \n\nIn short, this Kural emphasizes the role of one's environment in shaping one's character and life, urging us to choose our company wisely. The implications of this verse are highly relevant even today, resonating with the popular saying, \"Show me your friends and I'll show you your future.\""
